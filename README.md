# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Building a site to track personal mountaineering goals and progress. Expect to iterate as I learn new skills throughout the course.

*index.html serves as my home page with a short description of mountaineering and a striking photo.
*summits.html tracks summits I have climbed and want to climb in the future.
*skills.html tracks skills and gear I've acquired and the level of training or proficiency I have with that gear.
*resources.html is a page with links to outside resources.
*styles.css is my css styles sheet for all four html files.
